<h1>My Life Thus Far</h1>

				<p>My life as a student from primary to secondary to JC was fun. I was brought up in a pretty relaxed household where my parents didn't put much emphasis on academics and expected me to carve out my own path. However, being young and clueless, I didnt have a plan or career aspiration. My aim for every exam was to do just enough to not disappoint my parents and succeeded in doing just that. I passed my PSLE to get into the express stream, and moved on to get decent results for 'O' levels which qualified me to get into a neighbourhood JC. Thereafter, I spent most of my JC days playing soccer and hanging out with friends. It was only upon receiving my 'A' levels results that I realised being "average" was not good enough anymore. Due to the limited intake of Singapore local universities, the cut-off-point was extremely competitive. It was unlikely that I would have been accepted into any of them. I desperately made special appeals to every local university and fortunately after a year in the army, I received a letter of acceptance into NTU. I was accepted into a relatively new course at that time called Common Engineering where after the first semester, students will be streamed into more specific branches of engineering (unfortunately computer engineering/science was not one of the choices). Eventually, I chose Civil Engineering as my Major as I felt it resonated well with my desire to construct things and I could see myself building a passion for it.</p>

				<h2 class="title-box" style="background: #aabbcc">2. Civil Engineering Journey</h2>
				<p> Given the opportunity to study in a prestigious local university felt like a blessing and a second chance to excel in life. I told myself that I would not let this opportunity go to waste and put my heart and soul into my studies, which led me to attaining first-class-honors as well as 2 scholarships. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in university and Civil Engineering as my course of study. Upon graduating, I started working as a structural engineer in a consulting firm, where I continued to strive for exellence with the same drive that carried me through university. My workscope involves providing structural consultancy services throughout the life cycle of developments, which not only involves technical skills to conduct structural design studies but also interpersonal skills to communicate with clients and ensure proper coordination with multiple stakeholders. Unfortunately, after 1 year of soul searching in my job, I slowly came to a realisation that this industry was not for me. Although I find this career meaningful and challenging, one main factor that led me to my decision is that I disliked the traditional working culture and the huge resistance to change and acceptance of new technlologies. This is largely due to the fact that the construction industry is one of the oldest industries and it is experiencing an aging workforce. Another factor is that the construction industry is a sunset industry, and although there will always be a need for civil engineers, the long term career prospects seem bleak. </p>

				<h2 class="title-box" style="background: #ccddee">3. Why Software Engineering?</h2>
				<p>Computers had always fascinated me since I was young and many of my fondest childhood memories was playing video games. However, my first experience with real programming only began in my first semester of university, which was a foundation computing module in C. I fell in love with it. The logic, the syntax, the problem solving. I genuinely enjoyed the challenges, breezed through the module and got an A+. After this experience, I felt like I had found my calling. Unfortunately, computer engineering/science was not one of the specialisation options in my common engineering course, and hence after the first semester, I went with civil engineering.</p>
				<p>5 years later and here I am, taking my first steps towards being a software engineer. Though I sometimes wonder how things would be now if I made the jump earlier in university, I do not regret as I've made many great friends & fond memories in civil engineering. In addition, there are also many valuable skills that I have acquired through my civil engineering journey which I find will definitely be transferrable in my future career as a software engineer. This includes problem solving skills, picking up new concepts quickly, a never give up attitude as well as the ability to collaborate well in a team setting. Thank you for taking the time to read my life journey till the end. I am extremely excited for what the future holds for me as I continue to develop my skills in software engineering.</p>
